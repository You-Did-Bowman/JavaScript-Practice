/* ---------------------- ASTROLOGICAL READING SYSTEM ðŸŒŒ ----------------------

Create an Astrology class that accepts one parameter (zodiacId) during instantiation.

The class contains the following property:

zodiacSigns = [
  { id: 1, name: "Aries", element: "Fire", personality: ["bold", "ambitious", "confident"] },
  { id: 2, name: "Taurus", element: "Earth", personality: ["reliable", "patient", "practical"] },
  { id: 3, name: "Gemini", element: "Air", personality: ["curious", "affectionate", "adaptable"] }
];

Methods:
- getZodiac()
    Retrieves the zodiac sign (filtered by zodiacId) from the zodiacSigns array.
    Passes the selected sign to the displayReading() method.

- displayReading()
    Logs the message:
    "Your zodiac sign is <name>, an <element> sign. People born under this sign are often <personality traits>."

- luckyNumber()
    Generates a random lucky number between 1 and 100.
    Logs the message:
    "Your lucky number for today is <random number>."

Rules:
- The only method you should call manually is luckyNumber().
- The getZodiac() and displayReading() methods should be called automatically during instantiation.
