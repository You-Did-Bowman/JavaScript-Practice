# JavaScript-Practice

## About The Project
This repo contains tasks about JavaScript that I am completing in addition to my further training at DCI. I can find the tasks on various pages on the Internet. 
<br><br>
My most common sources are

* edabit: <a href="https://edabit.com/challenges"> edabit.com/challenges</a>
* cod√©dex: <a href="https://www.codedex.io/"> codedex.io</a>
* github

<br><br>
So far we have only covered the basics of the programming language. 
<br><br>
We learn the basics like:

* string / array methods
* if-else-statements
* loops:
  * for-loops
  * (do)while-loops
  * for-in-loops
  * for-of-loops
*   functions
  * function expressions
  * arrow functions
* objects
  * methods
* destructuring

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

### index_2024-11-7.js 
In this file I start with tasks on the subject of <b>shallow and deep copy</b>. We had discussed these two methods in class that day. Due to the importance of working with objects, I wanted to expand on this again that day. 
<br><br>
After these tasks, I completed other random tasks from Codedex. The focus here was on
  * Math.floor() and Math.random()
  * while-loops
  * for-loops
  * if-else-statements

### index_2024-11-11.js
Here I wanted to focus again on the topic of <b>destructuring</b> that I learnt today. In addition to the tasks from the lesson, I wanted to delve a little deeper into it because I realised that I need a little more practice, especially when working with arrays and destructuring, in order to understand the logic behind it.
