/* --------------------------- TASK 1 ---------------------------
There's a great war between the even and odd numbers. Many numbers already lost their lives in this war and it's your task to end this. You have to determine which group sums larger: the evens, or the odds. The larger group wins.

Create a function that takes an array of integers, sums the even and odd numbers separately, then returns the difference between the sum of the even and odd numbers. */

Write a function that reverses all the words in a sentence that start with a particular letter.Example:

specialReverse("word searches are super fun", "s")

/* --------------------------- TASK 3 ----------------------------
Take a look at the following code and describe in details (as much as you can) what the code is doing.
Answer the questions listed below.

const users = [
  {name: "Jake Smith", age: 20, city: "New York"},
  {name: "Anne Annson", age: 24, city: "London"},
  {name: "Pete Peterson", age: 31, city: "New York"},
  {name: "Martha Marty", age: 38, city: "New York"},
  {name: "Renato Romolo", age: 36, city: "Rome"},
  {name: "Philip Flip", age: 36, city: "London"},
];

const groupedByCity = users.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
  if (!accumulator[currentValue.city]) {
    accumulator[currentValue.city] = [];
  }
  accumulator[currentValue.city].push(currentValue);
  return accumulator;
}, {})

console.log(groupedByCity);

A - why do we need this line of code?   if (!accumulator[currentValue.city]) {
B - What if I replace "if (!accumulator[currentValue.city]) { " with  "if (!acc.hasOwnProperty(city))"?
C - Which of the above is the safest approach? 
D - What is the value of the accumulator during the second iteration?  "accumulator[currentValue.city].push(currentValue)"
E - What is happening here and why do we need that?  }, {}) */
